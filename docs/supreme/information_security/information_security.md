The Foundation has tightened and strict policies on information and the security of that information. These policies are enforced heavily. While some punishments are seen as excessive, information may be used against the Foundation.

Information such as guidelines, communications and departmental content have their own categorization. From Security Clearance 1 to Security Clearance 5. Do note that Security Clearance and Security Class are separate. Information Security Measures can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11aVV64LHUyc32cb6qUhWd77qke7VDFFOcFTSePmTn18). If an information breach was to occur, a report is to be filed with any available member of the Department of Internal Affairs.
