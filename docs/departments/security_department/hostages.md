It is recommended that all Security personnel read through this document: [Universal Hostage Regulations]
(https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DrnAEcUAkOTaK3xupDz-ADeKz7XXRhOQChxyecFswIM/edit?usp=sharing)

One way for Class D personnel to cause havoc around the site is by taking facility personnel as hostages and putting combatives on their toes to find a way to successfully rescue them. Usually Class D will attempt to negotiate with combatives to gain something from said hostages.

There are a number of regulations that both Class D and combatives have to follow when in a hostage situation. Firstly, **the only security subdivision allowed to negotiate with hostage takers and rescue the hostages is the Security Response Unit.** Combat Medics are allowed to stay on _standby_, ready to heal any injured or downed personnel. The **Military Police** are allowed to secure a perimeter disallowing any entrance, other than the aforementioned divisions.

:::caution
Other subdivisions and division-less Security personnel are **not allowed to attempt to rescue hostages**, except in the following case. Any Security member is allowed to terminate a Class D hostage taker(s) if the hostage situation is confirmed to be invalidated. Before terminating any of the hostage takers, ensure you have valid proof of it, otherwise, you will likely be punished.
