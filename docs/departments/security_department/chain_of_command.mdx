The Chain of Command is a very important aspect of the Security Department. Each position is defined within this chain. The chain of command must be followed at all times. When contacting a command member regarding something, follow this chain of command:

> **3 Officers > 3 Inspectors > Chief**

Do not contact the Security Chiefs for matters easily solvable by Security Officers or Inspectors.

## Security Chief <Highlight color="#e13238">SC-4</Highlight> _(Max 2)_

### Description

The Security Chief is seen as the Director of the Security Department. They are responsible for maintaining the department’s overall core. The Security Chiefs are also able to promote Security Officers to Security Inspector. The Security Chiefs are chosen by the Overseer of the Security Department. There may only ever be two Security Chiefs at one given time.

## Security Inspector <Highlight color="#0084ff">SC-3</Highlight> _(Max 6)_

Security Inspectors are seen as the core management of the Security Department, primarily overseeing operations carried out by Security Officers, as well as drafting up necessary information to present to the Security Chiefs. Security Inspectors are chosen by the Security Chiefs and are promoted from Security Officers. There may only be seven Security Inspectors at one given time unless overruled by the Overseer of the Security Department.

## Security Officer <Highlight color="#3dae72">SC-2</Highlight> _(Max 20)_

Security Officers are considered the Medium Command of the Security Department. They are responsible for leading on-duty security personnel while on site, and they may be seen as a point of guidance. Security Officers are also responsible for hosting trainings and doing administrative work such as disciplining personnel and handling promotions. There may only be twenty-five Security Officers at any given time.

## Security Sentry <Highlight color="#3dae72">SC-2</Highlight> _(Max 30)_

Security Sentry is the highest non-command position, and are in-training to become Security Officers. Security Sentry are able to host trainings with supervision, as well as supervise Security Cadets during tests, and authorise them inside the Class D containment zone. They have slightly more authority then a regular guard whilst on-site.

Fair reminder: This rank cannot be easily obtained, reaching the first 7 requirements will not grant you this rank. Only those most competent and dedicated will attain the position.

## Security Guard <Highlight color="#3dae72">SC-2</Highlight>

Security Guards are the 2nd low-ranking position. Security Guards are eligible to co-host trainings hosted by Security Officers. And are still able to apply for the Military Police and Combat Medic Subdivisions as well as contend in SRU Tryouts. Security Guard’s have the same power on-site as Security Sentry, meaning they’re able to supervise Security Cadets during tests, and authorise them inside the Class D containment zone.

## Security Junior <Highlight color="#3dae72">SC-2</Highlight>

Security Juniors are considered the third low-ranking position. This position is eligible to apply for the Military Police and Combat Medics subdivisions.

## Security Cadet <Highlight color="#adecd0">SC-1</Highlight>

Security Cadets are considered to be the lowest ranking position in the Security Department. Security Cadets must pass a Cadet Orientation in order to go in-game in the Security Department team.

:::warning

_(You may request for an extension should you feel you are unable to accomplish your requirements with the given time. Inspector+)_
