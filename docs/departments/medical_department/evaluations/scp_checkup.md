- Request one security escort to the Transfer Gate.
- Have the security escort take you to Site Epsilon.
- Inform MP/SRU/MTF that you will be conducting an SCP checkup. Or alternatively, if an entity of SCP-131, -368, -662, or -999  is found roaming in Phi or Omicron, and it is willing to come with you, you may take it to the Medbay directly and skip traversing to its Epsilon containment chamber.
- Head to the SCPs chamber and take them to the Medbay, if the SCP is 082/049/1048/662 then you will require an escort from MP/SRU/MTF.
- Introduce yourself to the SCP and tell them to lay on the bed.
- Give the SCP a memory phrase if it is SCP-082/049.
- If your SCP is -131, -368, -999, or -1048, give it a task to remember.
- Ask the SCP four (4) questions about their health.
- Tell the SCP to stand on the weight scale.
- Give the SCP three (3) physical tasks.
- Finally, give the SCP a brief description of their health & any recommendations that will prevent any further health problems. 
- <strong>Miscellaneous</strong>: Physician+ are able to do check ups on Pan Stan, Frosty, and The Troll. You may not ping Anomaly Actors to get on for these. You are only to ask the subject when they are on site to do a checkup. Follow all listed procedures above.
